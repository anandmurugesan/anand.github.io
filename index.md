## Various and sundry

From December 2023 to February 2024, I'll be shuttling (actually, riding or pillion riding a motorbike) across the Tamil Nadu and Kerala border (Palakkad-Pollachi), conducting fieldwork for the Valuing Democracy project. Some stills from the field: 

<img src="Palakkad_Vengodi_Training.jpeg" width="225" height="150" /> <img src="Palakkad_Para_LunchPlace.jpeg" width="225" height="150" /> 

Debriefing and training enumerators at the field office in Vengodi, Palakkad, and our go-to lunch spot (Hotel Venkatesh Bhavan, Para).

<img src="PoliticianInterview_Ramassery.jpeg" width="225" height="150" /> <img src="Idli_Ramassery.jpeg" width="225" height="150" /> 

Interviewing a local politician with Libin and stopping for the famed Ramasseri idli with Sreenivasan Ji. [Is it an idli or a dosa?](https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/ramasseri-idli-a-fusion-of-an-idli-and-a-dosa/article34206074.ece)

<img src="Palakkad_Thenari_TeaShopDiscussion.jpeg" width="225" height="150" /> <img src="Palakkad_Para_Bike.jpeg" width="225" height="150" /> 

An impromptu discussion at a tea stall (with the stall owner, an insightful old friend of Sreenivasan Ji's father). The trusted Honda got us around.

An inspiring visit to the [Khadi](https://www.mkgandhi.org/swadeshi_khadi/whatiskhadi.htm) cottage industry next door (we bought handmade fabric, made to fit by a local tailor) and taking in the moment with a view of the Silent Valley.

My brother worked on [the effect of angular momentum or spin velocity in the formation of galaxies](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/483/2/2398/5222687); more recently on examining [the interactive effect of angular momentum and gravitation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.08103.pdf) in the formation of celestial bodies. My brother lives in the part of the world where, in theory, water flowing down the drain is expected to spin in the opposite direction compared to the drains in parts I am in... ;) <br/>

*"The first principle is that you must not fool yourself -- and you are the easiest person to fool. So you have to be very careful about that.
